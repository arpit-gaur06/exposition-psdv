It is built on top of VTK (Visualization Toolkit) and offers an easy-to-use, Pythonic API for creating and interacting with 3D models, meshes, and volumetric data.\n\nPythonic VTK: a high-level API to the Visualization Toolkit (VTK)\nmesh data structures and filtering methods for spatial datasets\n3D plotting made simple and built for large/complex data geometries\n\nPyVista is a helper library for the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) that takes a different approach on interfacing with VTK through NumPy and direct array access. This package provides a Pythonic, well-documented interface exposing VTKâ€™s powerful visualization backend to facilitate rapid prototyping, analysis, and visual integration of spatially referenced datasets.\nThis module can be used for scientific plotting for presentations and research papers as well as a supporting module for other mesh dependent Python modules."
